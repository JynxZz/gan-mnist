# Exploration to create a GAN for Generating MNIST Handwritten Digits


The project is inspired by the work of Jason Brownlee [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-generative-adversarial-network-for-an-mnist-handwritten-digits-from-scratch-in-keras/)


The idea is to create both a generation model (generator) and a model to identify fakes (discriminator).
Both will learn from each other

### Exploration
During exploration, the point will be to create both models separatly.
* Discrimator Model (exploration & script)
* Generator Model (exploration & script)

### Script
After the creation of both models, the aim will be to regroup all methods inside the same script for a generating MNIST handwritting digits.
* GAN script

### To Continue
The final step is to see if it's possible to generate handwritting text (if the data exist, we can do it)
